# Introduction

In this project we explored data about movie production using pandas to work with datasets and make visualizations. This project utilizes data we were given for the module one project in order to make recommendations to Microsoft if they were considering going into the movie business. 

## Research Questions:
- Do IMDb user ratings relate to profit or budget?
- What genres are the most profitable?
- Does runtime affect movie gross?
